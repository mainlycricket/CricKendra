I am building `CricKendra` out of my passion for cricket and programming.

- I am currently working on the [`stats-engine` branch](https://github.com/mainlycricket/CricKendra/tree/stats-engine)
- Checkout the Postman Collection [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25403102/2sAYBREZ3x)

This is only the backend repository. My friend [Akshay Dixit](https://github.com/Akshay-pro) is developing the front-end. Checkout the front-end repo [here](https://github.com/Akshay-pro/CricKendra).
