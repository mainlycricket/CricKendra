I am building `CricKendra` out of my passion for cricket and programming.

### Current Progress

- A CSV parser - [`cmd/csv-parser`](./cmd/csv-parser) - that extracts data from CSV files available on [cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org) and saves in the database.

- A main server - [`cmd/main-server`](./cmd/main-server) - that provides basic endpoints, currently focused on stats engine.

### Resources
